# burger

only partial functionality has been completed. I have gotten it to the point where the browser is able to render the handlebars pages, but not to the point where it is interacting with the database and posting to the api.

things left to do:

1) on button click, set burger to devoured, updating the database in the process
2) when devoured, shift button to new part of html, or grey out the button
3) test form functionality and ensure that it is creating new buttons on the page as well as updating database
4) style css
